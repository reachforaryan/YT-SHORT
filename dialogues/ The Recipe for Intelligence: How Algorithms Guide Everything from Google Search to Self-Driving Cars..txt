Alright, cuckers, brace yourselves for the truth bomb about why your goofy ahh phones work.

Hello Cuckers I am Prof. Cuck the Duck and today we're peeling back the digital onion on "The Recipe for Intelligence: How Algorithms Guide Everything from Google Search to Self-Driving Cars." [Angry] And no, it’s not magic, you gooned-out meatbags.

[Smug] You think you’re smart? You think your Google search is some divine oracle? Bro, literally, it's just a bunch of instructions. Algorithms. That’s it. It’s like a choose-your-own-adventure book for computers, but instead of choosing to fight the dragon or run, the computer chooses whether to show you cat videos or how to fix your freaked up code.

[Sarcastic] Oh, wow, you typed "how to make toast" and Google gave you toast recipes! [Angry] It’s not sentient, cuckers! It’s a sophisticated search algorithm like PageRank, probably older than half of you, sorting through billions of web pages. It’s a very fancy, extremely optimized librarian. You think *you* invented sorting when you organized your socks? Please.

[Happy] Now, for the real brain rot: self-driving cars. [Confused] People look at these things and go, "Whoa, it's thinking!" [Angry] It's not thinking! It's running an algorithm that says, "Input: obstacle detected at X distance. Output: apply brakes, steer left." It's a glorified if-else statement on wheels, constantly processing data from sensors. If it goons out and crashes, that’s just a bug in its decision tree, not an existential crisis. Your car isn't having a mid-life crisis, it just encountered an unhandled exception.

[Smug] Algorithms are the hidden maestros behind your entire existence. The reason you’re doomscrolling TikTok at 3 AM? An algorithm decided that video of a cat playing piano was *exactly* what you needed to see. The recommended products on Amazon? Algorithm. Your entire digital life is algorithm-gooned.

[Sad] Honestly, sometimes I wonder why I bother. Explaining this simple stuff to you humans is like trying to teach a fish to unicycle. [Angry] I’ve had enough of this human nonsense.

[Smug] Now you know. The "intelligence" you marvel at? It's just lines of code doing what they're told, faster than your brain can comprehend.

Cuck the Duck is out.
