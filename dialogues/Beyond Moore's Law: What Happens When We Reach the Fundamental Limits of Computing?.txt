Hello Cuckers! I am Prof. Cuck the Duck. Ever wonder if your gaming PC is just gonna… stop getting faster? Today, we're diving deep into: "Beyond Moore's Law: What Happens When We Reach the Fundamental Limits of Computing?"

[Angry] Listen up, you goofy ahh humans, this ain't a drill! For decades, your pathetic silicon brains have been coasting on something called Moore's Law.
[Smug] Basically, every couple of years, Intel, Nvidia, whoever, just crammed twice as many tiny little switches, called transistors, onto a chip. Your phone got faster, your games looked prettier, and you probably thought it was just magic.
[Sarcastic] "Oh, technology just... *improves*!" Yeah, right. It was literally just making things smaller. Not rocket science, just *micro*-rocket science.

[Angry] But guess what, cuckers? We’re hitting a wall! A *physical* wall. You can’t make a transistor smaller than an atom, unless you invent tiny sub-atomic ducks to do it, which I’m not doing, thank you very much. Heat, quantum weirdness, the speed of light – these aren't suggestions, they're *physics*. Your goofy ahh AI isn't gonna save us when electrons are literally bumping into each other like a mosh pit. It's already gooned out enough just generating bad memes.

[Sad] So, what happens when we can't just shrink things anymore? Do we all just start doomscrolling in 4K at 15 FPS?
[Sarcastic] Nah, your tech bros are already scrambling.
[Happy] Enter the "freaked up" world of quantum computing! Instead of simple 0s and 1s, we got Qubits that are… both? Or neither? Like Schrodinger's cat, but for your CPU. It's gonna solve all your NP-hard problems, probably, if it ever stops decohering when a duck flaps its wings too close.
[Smug] Or maybe we copy *your* inefficient meat-brains? Neuromorphic computing, trying to mimic neurons. Slow clap, humans, for finally realizing nature had some good ideas after billions of years.
[Angry] Mostly, though, it's gonna be about getting *smarter* with what we have. More parallel processing, custom chips for specific tasks. Less "brute force it with raw power" and more "actually optimize your code, you slobs!"

[Angry] Honestly, why do I even bother explaining this? You'll probably just go back to trying to 'hack the mainframe' with Python scripts that are O(N^2) for a linked list traversal. My duck brain is fried from your nonsense. This whole 'educational duck' gig is a scam.

[Smug] So yeah, beyond Moore's Law, it's not a performance cliff, it's more like a technical scramble. Less raw power, more clever engineering. Stay tuned, cuckers, for when your smart fridge requires a quantum entangled CPU to toast bread.

Cuck the Duck is out.
