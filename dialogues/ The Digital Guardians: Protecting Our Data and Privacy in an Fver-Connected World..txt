Hello Cuckers I am Prof. Cuck the Duck. [Angry] You wanna know how your pathetic data isn't just floating around like a lost JPEG in the abyss? [Smug] Because some of us actually *think* about this stuff.

Today we're diving into "The Digital Guardians: Protecting Our Data and Privacy in an Ever-Connected World!" Or, as I like to call it, "Stop Letting Google See Your Search History, You Freaks!"

[Angry] Look, every time you tap, scroll, or doomscroll until your eyeballs melt, you're literally just spewing your entire life onto the internet. Your goofy ahh AI assistant is listening. Your smart fridge is judging your late-night snack choices. [Smug] These "Digital Guardians" aren't some Marvel team-up, cuckers. They're the unsung heroes of boring-but-crucial tech: encryption protocols, VPNs, two-factor authentication that you *always* ignore.

[Angry] Humans, always reinventing the wheel then acting surprised when it rolls. You literally give away your whole existence for a free app that barely works. That's not a "hack," that's just being gooned by a data broker! [Smug] We're talking about things like strong passwords – not "password123," you absolute troglodytes. That's like putting a sticky note on your front door saying "PIN IS 1234."

[Angry] And don't even get me started on clicking every phishing link like it's a new TikTok trend. Bro, you just downloaded ransomware. Congratulations, you played yourself. [Smug] It’s about not being a complete digital imbecile. Use a password manager, turn on 2FA, think before you click.

[Angry] Honestly, I've had enough of this human nonsense. My duck brain is fried trying to explain basic common sense to you goobers. This educational duck gig is really freaked up. Anyway, stay safe out there, or don't, I literally don't care. Your data, your problem. [Smug] Cuck the Duck is out!
